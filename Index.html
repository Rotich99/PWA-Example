    <h2>Welcome to my First PWA</h2>
    <p>What is a PWA? A PWA is a progressive web Application.Progressive web apps enable websites to function more like native mobile apps in exchange for some flexibility. You get native mobile app functionality (or close to it) without all the overhead of app store approvals and tons of platform-specific native code. Users can install a progressive web app to their home screen and launch it just like a native app. However, the app is launched into a pseudo-app frame that has some restrictions and only allows access to pages that are sub-paths of the initial path of the progressive web app. They also must be served over HTTPS.
    The core of a progressive web app is the service worker, which is effectively a client-side JavaScript daemon. Service workers can listen for a few kinds of events and react to them. One of the most commonly supported events is the fetch event, which can be used to cache web content offline as explained below.
    Many websites fit just fine within the rules and restrictions of progressive web apps. Instead of waiting for Apple or Google to approve and push out native app updates, progressive web app updates are fetched by a service worker following standard HTTP caching rules. Plus, progressive web apps can now use many native APIs like the geolocation, camera, and sensor APIs that only native mobile apps used to be able to take advantage of.</p>
